#### ...why am I writing blog and why should You care?

There are a couple of reasons. All a bit from a different time and space but all aiming towards same goal or a solution. Let me explain...

#### Who am I?

I am a professional software engineer, a husband to wonderful woman, a father to two utmost resolute boys and a die-hard tinkerer. After a lot of hours spent building and dissassembling, breaking and repairing things I realised that it still does make me happy but I feel something else about it. When my boys entered this world I felt that I want to share this passion with them. And not only with them. In a world blessed (and cursed too) with vast space of the Internet, holding almost anything You ever imagined You can learn almost anything. And this is all thanks to people who share. Their successes, failures, achievements and thoughts can make Your world and my world better. I want to contribute to that.

#### What is in it for You?

Information, inspiration and entertainment. These three things will be on my mind when creating content for this blog. If, like me, You are interested in TnT (technology and tinkering, maybe a bit of explosives too) then I do hope You will find this blog fun. What kind of topics will I cover here? Probably wide variety, just to name a few: embedded software and hardware, cybersecurity, creating home server and hosting services, STEM activities for my children, contributing to open projects or trying them out, learning and living technology, and probably many more.

I will be also posting some content related to my work experience, some tips and tricks and things someone may see as valueable.

#### Something for me as well.

This is my first blog. I could even say that it is a first serious attempt to content creation. My very first digital, public space. I plan to use it to hone my creative and interacting skills, have some digital presence. Maybe even create project logs, portfolios or just place to store my running thoughts. 

Beside that I feel that I need a space which somehow bridges my work life and passion for technology in an unrestrictive or maybe less dependent way. A place to release some creative steam even if it may achieve nothing particular. A place that is my cave in this crazy daily life.

#### Immediate plans for this space?
Since those are my first steps then I probably need to learn how to walk. I will be writing more posts and publishing them as time allows. I plan to integrate comment system in this site so I can interact with You my dear Reader. 


#### And You? Don't You have a good reason to start something new?
