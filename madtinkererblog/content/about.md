#### Add a picture

I am an engineer with 8.5 years in engineering industry and graduated robotics master's degree university course after 4,5 years. I am tinkering with technical stuff since I can remember. I worked in various projects both as a robotics engineer and embedded SW engineer. I touched robotized manufacturing industry, electronics and SW development for household products, IoT and automotive. I tried open source contributions in voice recognition project of Mozilla and got recognized in online maker contest by element14. 

All this made me realise that I need to share my experience, knowledge and skills so You can grow and tinker as well. I want You to realise Your creative potential that tinkering can unleash in You no matter what Your background is or how old You are. I want to explore possibilities and ease of access offered by modern technologies and I want to take You along this journey. Let us both take a look at things both known and new and let us learn together, like partner tinkerers `:)` . 

If that sounds compeling why don't You start reading about [how to organize thoughts](/content/front-matter)? Or drop me a message on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jakubwrobel7/)? Also You can leave a comment on any blogpost or project You found interesting here.

Thanks for being a part of tech enthusiast community.
